Lab 7: CI/CD pipeline to automate SOAR content deployment using GitHub Actions.
Lab 7: CI/CD Pipeline for SOAR Content
Lab Title
CI/CD Pipeline for SOAR Content Deployment
Objective
To automate the continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) of SOAR playbooks using GitHub Actions. This lab demonstrates how security teams can streamline the deployment of detection content such as phishing playbooks into SOAR platforms in a version-controlled and automated manner.
Tools and Technologies Used
- GitHub Actions
- YAML
- Git & GitHub
- Ubuntu Runner
Scope of the Lab
- Simulate CI/CD workflow for SOAR platform integration.
- Validate detection playbooks before deployment.
- Trigger deployment pipeline on every code push to the master branch.
Case Study Context
Security teams often need to update SOAR platforms with new or modified playbooks (e.g., phishing triage workflows). Manual updates can introduce errors and slow down response times. CI/CD pipelines ensure these updates are deployed consistently and automatically once validated.
Implementation Steps
1. Repository Setup
   - Created GitHub repository `lab7-ci-cd-soar-content`
   - Added `playbooks/phishing_response.yml`
   - Created `.github/workflows/main.yml`

2. Workflow Design
   - Defined a CI/CD GitHub Actions workflow to validate and simulate deployment

3. Commit & Trigger Workflow
   - Resolved YAML syntax error (duplicate `on:`)
   - Successful CI/CD deployment simulation
Methods & Strategies
- Push-to-deploy strategy
- Modular YAML structure
- Placeholder validation using `cat` command
Skills Applied
- CI/CD automation
- YAML scripting
- GitHub workflows
- Error debugging
Challenges Faced
- YAML duplication error fixed
- Ensured file presence before deployment
- Synced GitHub Actions triggers
Limitations
- Only simulated deployments
- No schema validation
- No secure credential integration
Must-Do for Real Implementation
- Replace echo with API calls
- Implement formal validations
- Use GitHub secrets
- Add pre-deployment tests
Contributions to Real Work Scenario
- Automated playbook updates
- Integrated validation checks
- Version control usage
- Human error reduction
